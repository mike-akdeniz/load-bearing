# Load-Bearing

*Which Software Principles Hold, and Where They Stop*

**Many claims you meet about software are one of five kinds, and the kind determines how much authority it has** — not the confidence of the person saying it, not their track record, not how widely it is repeated.
The same wiring code is unremarkable in Go and gets sent back in review in C#, and neither version is more correct.

**Your clock cannot tell you what happened first.**
Two consecutive reads of the system clock return the same number 95% of the time — on one machine, with nothing going wrong.
That number is measured, not asserted.

**You cannot tell a late reply from one that is never coming.**
Not that it is hard. You cannot — and most of what is impossible in distributed systems follows from it.
Asking *are you still there?* does not help either: a reply proves the channel works now, and your question was about the past.

**"This should be a Repository." What would that rule out?**
A design pattern name earns its place by forbidding something.
Run that test on the names you use in code review and count how many survive it.

**Why design arguments don't get settled.**
Because both sides are arguing about the answer while disagreeing about the situation — and nobody wrote the situation down.
→ [Chapter 03 — Forces: The Inputs Nobody Names](03_forces_f4m5.md)

Those are five of twenty-two chapters. Each one makes a claim and states where it stops.

## The premise

Most software advice is true.
Almost none of it says what *kind* of claim it is.

"Dependencies must be acyclic" is nearly a mathematical fact.
"Every repository gets an interface" is a local convention of one ecosystem.
Both arrive in the same tone of voice, in the same conference talk, from people with equal confidence.
So the convention gets applied with the force of a law, and the law gets treated as one option among several.

This book is a field guide for telling the difference.
Its central question is the one a builder asks before knocking out a wall: **is this load-bearing?**
Some walls carry the structure.
Some are partitions someone painted to look structural.
Removing the first brings the roof down; removing the second is redecorating.

The book is written to be **received**, not obeyed.
Its subject is how to read advice — a blog post, a review comment, a pattern name, a strong opinion in a meeting — and place it correctly before deciding what to do about it.

## The spine: five kinds

Every chapter classifies its material against this table. Four of the five are advice and form a ladder of authority; Force is not advice, which is why there are four levels and five kinds.

| | What it is | Authority | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Law** | true by the mechanics of computation | absolute | acyclic dependency; check-then-act races |
| **Force** | properties of your situation | not advice — inputs | concurrency, durability, blast radius, team size |
| **Principle** | good advice *given* certain Forces | conditional | "put the rule where it can be enforced" |
| **Idiom** | ecosystem conventions | local, non-transferable | free functions in Go; DI containers in C# |
| **Style** | arbitrary but worth consistency | none, but pick one | naming, formatting |

The recurring failure, which appears in every part of this book:

> **An Idiom gets promoted to a Law by advocacy, then applied where the Forces don't hold.**

## The rule this book holds itself to

**No chapter ships without a real counter-example.**

Every chapter has a mandatory *Where the claim doesn't apply* section containing a worked case, not a hedge.
"This always applies" is never an acceptable answer — if a boundary can't be found, that is evidence the claim is too vague to be useful, not evidence that it is universal.

This applies to Laws too.
They don't stop being true, but they stop being *relevant*, and knowing when they stop mattering is the same skill.

## How this book was written

The ideas, the arguments and the examples are the author's; the prose was drafted by a large language model (Claude), one chapter at a time, and then edited and sent back.

The thesis — that software advice comes in kinds of differing authority, and that most of the damage comes from confusing them — began as a page of handwritten notes, not as a prompt.

Those notes came out of building [FlowCore](https://github.com/mike-akdeniz/flowcore), a Go workflow library whose design decisions were argued through and written down one at a time, as they were made.
Asking which of its choices were forced, which were conventional, and which were only habit is what turned into this book.

Every chapter is read, argued with, and sent back — 95 review passes of the author's own are in the commit history.
The drafts have so far contained a contradiction that survived a full pass, a shortcut rule that was exactly backwards, and a claim about single-stack teams that experience says is false.
Each was caught by the author, not by the model, and each is recorded in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) with the reasoning that settled it.

Structural decisions — the title, the terminology, the chapter list, what gets cut, and what the book refuses to claim — are the author's.

So: **the sentences are generated; the argument, the judgment, and the responsibility for what it says are the author's.**
The decision log is there so that claim can be checked rather than taken on trust.

## Contents

All twenty-two chapters, in six parts, are listed in **[`00_toc.md`](00_toc.md)**.
Each chapter states its own claim and where that claim stops, so the contents page lists them and leaves the arguing to them.

How the book is put together — the chapter rubric, the language conventions, the running example, the license and how to cite it — is in **[`docs/ABOUT.md`](docs/ABOUT.md)**.

> **Status: v1.0.0.** All twenty-two chapters are written and have been read end to end.
