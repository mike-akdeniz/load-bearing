*Part VI — Your Own Decisions*

# What Was Never Written Down

## The claim

**An unrecorded decision made by a person can be recovered while the person still remembers it. Made by an AI coding agent there is nothing to recover: the computation that selected it was discarded as it ran, and only text persists.**

Every chapter before this one works on a claim somebody made. A proverb, a review comment, a pattern name, a rule in a style guide — the technique throughout has been to find the condition behind the assertion and check whether it holds here. This chapter is about the case where there is no assertion, because the decision was taken without ever being written down.

A decision is not a sixth kind of claim. It is what the five produce when they meet a situation: a Law with something to act on, a Principle that holds at this reading of the Forces and would not at another, an Idiom that arrived with the ecosystem, a Style that neither the compiler nor the runtime can see. What changes here is the direction. Until now the advice arrived from outside and the work was to place it; here you are the one producing it.

---

## A decision nobody wrote down

Here is a function that fetches a workflow definition and its steps. It is two queries, and they are wrapped in a transaction.

```python
def get_definition(connection, definition_id):
    connection.execute("BEGIN")
    definition = connection.execute(
        "SELECT name, revision FROM definitions WHERE id = ?", (definition_id,)
    ).fetchone()
    steps = connection.execute(
        "SELECT position, label FROM steps WHERE definition_id = ? ORDER BY position",
        (definition_id,),
    ).fetchall()
    connection.execute("COMMIT")
    return definition, steps
```

The transaction looks like ceremony. Nothing is written, so there is nothing to roll back, and a reader who has been taught that transactions are for writes will see two harmless `SELECT`s inside a wrapper that does no work.

It is doing work. Definitions are edited while they are being read, so between the first query and the second an editor can commit a change. Without the wrapper the two queries take separate snapshots, and the function returns a definition assembled from both sides of that edit — a version number from before it and a step list from after it.

Somebody later removes the wrapper, because "it does nothing":

```python
def get_definition(connection, definition_id):
    definition = connection.execute(
        "SELECT name, revision FROM definitions WHERE id = ?", (definition_id,)
    ).fetchone()
    steps = connection.execute(
        "SELECT position, label FROM steps WHERE definition_id = ? ORDER BY position",
        (definition_id,),
    ).fetchall()
    return definition, steps
```

Both versions run. Both pass a test suite that does not have a concurrent editor in it. With one committing an edit between the two reads, they differ:

```text
with the transaction:     revision 1, steps ['collect-id', 'verify']
without the transaction:  revision 1, steps ['collect-id', 'verify', 'approve']
```

The second row is revision 1 of a definition that has three steps. **No such definition was ever saved.** Revision 1 had two steps and revision 2 has three, and the function has returned a tree assembled from both. Nothing raised, nothing logged, and the caller has a workflow that never existed.

*(The interleaving is forced in the run above so that it happens every time. In a running system it happens when it happens, which is the part that makes it expensive to find.)*

Nothing in either version says which of the two is right, and the file is where somebody will look. The entry that would have settled it is later in this chapter, and it names the Forces and marks the transaction as forced rather than chosen.

## Why asking the agent afterwards does not get it back

If the transaction was put there by a person, there is a period during which you can find out why. They remember, or they wrote it down, or somebody who was in the room remembers. The period is finite and it is longer than nothing.

If it was put there by an AI coding agent, the intuition is that the same applies while the session is open — that you can ask, and the reason will come back. That intuition is wrong, and the reason is architectural rather than a matter of how good the tool is.

**A forward pass discards its activations.** Whatever computation selected the transaction over its absence produced a token and was not retained. The key-value cache holds values derived from tokens and exists to avoid recomputation; it is not a record of the decision that produced them. Every mechanism an agentic coding tool has for persisting anything — the context window, the transcript, a memory file, a project instructions file — stores **text**. So there is never a replay. There is only whatever was written.

Which gives three cases, and they are not equally bad.

```text
 same session, decision was written out
   you are reading text. Real retrieval — of what was said,
   not of what happened.

 same session, decision was not written
   a fresh computation runs on overlapping input and produces
   a correlated answer. Not a recollection. Often right.

 new session
   only the artifact is in context. The prompt that produced
   the code is gone.
```

**The middle case is the one that does the damage**, because it is right often enough to be trusted and is a correlation rather than a memory. *Ask it while the context is fresh* is advice that works, until the day it does not, and there is no signal that distinguishes the two occasions.

There was a computation that produced this line of code rather than another one, and there was never a sentence saying why. Asking afterwards does not retrieve that sentence, because there is none to retrieve. The model can only write a new one.

**This chapter needs less than the research beside it, and deliberately so.** Whether the explanation a model gives for its own output describes what actually produced it is an open question, with results on both sides. One experiment changed something in the input that demonstrably moved the answer, and found the explanations carried on without mentioning the change. A later paper disputes what that shows: an explanation is a compressed account of a computation that was never a line of reasoning to begin with, so leaving something out is not the same as misreporting it, and the unmentioned thing can still be doing its work.

Those questions are different from the one grilling answers later on. A model accounting for its own output afterwards is what the research contests. *A decision put to a person before any code is written, and settled by the facts that person supplied*, is not — **the load-bearing half of that record came from them.** And the chapter rests on the narrower fact that what persists is text, so what can be recovered is what was recorded.

Finally, one thing does survive without deliberate effort, and it is worth separating out because it gets conflated with the decisions. **What the code does is re-derivable from the code**, by a person or by the agent, at any time. Asking for a description of behaviour is reading. Asking why this shape was chosen is not — that was never in the artifact, and no amount of freshness puts it there.

## Grilling: making the decision happen in the open

Reading the Forces before the design exists assumes you already know which decisions are about to be made. Usually you do not — not because you are careless, but because until the decisions are in front of you there is no telling which facts about your situation are about to matter.

One technique inverts the flow, and it is worth stating in full. [Chapter 02](02_the-five-kinds_cjx4.md) gives the direction that makes a claim checkable: the facts first, the advice after. Grilling runs that backwards on purpose — the decisions are surfaced one at a time, and you supply the fact that settles each one as it arrives. The prompt, quoted as the author of this book uses it:

> Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the decision tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.
>
> Ask the questions one at a time, waiting for feedback on each question before continuing. Asking multiple questions at once is bewildering.
>
> If a *fact* can be found by exploring the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), look it up rather than asking me. The *decisions*, though, are mine — put each one to me and wait for my answer.
>
> Do not act on it until I confirm we have reached a shared understanding.

The technique is not this book's. It comes from Matt Pocock's skills repository, as `skills/productivity/grilling/SKILL.md`, and this book's author encountered this use of it through a video by Jason Ku. The version quoted above is an earlier one, frozen here because the upstream text has since changed.

**The split between fact and decision is the load-bearing line.** Facts get looked up; decisions get put to the human. That is reading a Force and choosing from what it leaves, separated and given different owners — and the separation is what makes the output auditable, because every decision arrives with a recommendation you either took or overrode.

The recommendation attached to each question is where the value is, and it takes an example to see why. Two questions from the start of a real library, with the answers that were actually given:

```text
> Should ids be generated by the application or by the database?
  Recommended: the database, via a column default. One less thing
  for a client to get wrong.

< The application. A client assembles a whole definition offline
  and hands it over in one call, so the ids have to exist before
  any of it reaches Postgres.

> Then UUIDv4 or UUIDv7?
  Recommended: v4. It is the common default.

< v7. These are primary keys on a table that only grows, and v4
  scatters inserts across the index.
```

Both recommendations were sensible, both were overridden, and the same kind of thing did the overriding each time: a fact about this library that is not in any corpus.

The first is about how the library is used — a client builds a whole definition in memory before any part of it exists, so ids cannot come from a column default without splitting the call. The second is a latency-budget reading at volume: these are primary keys on a table that only grows, and v4 scatters inserts across the index.

Only the second is one of [chapter 03](03_forces_f4m5.md)'s seven, which does not claim to be a closed list. What makes both of them Forces is that each is checkable, and each says what would have to change for the answer to change.

And note who supplied them. In both cases the human, because both are facts about this situation — which is the one thing a recommendation drawn from what is common cannot contain. The recommendation is the majority ecosystem's convention arriving in the voice of an answer, which is an Idiom ([Ch. 02](02_the-five-kinds_cjx4.md)) with its locality stripped off.

The alternative is not that these two decisions go unmade. Without the interview both would still have been taken — a column default and a call to a v4 constructor, chosen by whatever is most common, with nothing in the file showing that anything was chosen at all. That is the case this chapter is about.

The narrower point here is the one worth keeping: **grilling does not produce better answers. It produces answers somebody can disagree with.**

And disagreeing with them later requires that they were written down. The interview produces a sequence of decisions with the reasoning attached, and the reasoning is the perishable half: an hour afterwards the code is still there and the override is not. So the last step of the loop is that each settled decision goes into the log.

That closes the circuit, and it is worth seeing as one thing rather than three. The interview surfaces the decision, the log records what settled it, and a standing instructions file promotes the answers that keep recurring into constraints so the same question stops being asked. Grilling without that second step is a conversation rather than a record, and a conversation is exactly what does not survive the session.

**Whether promoting a rule into the instructions is worth anything depends on what the log entry behind it says.** Two documents are in play and they hold different things. The **decision log** is the reasoning, one entry per decision, kept in FlowCore as `docs/decisions.md`. The **instructions file** is the set of rules an agent is given at the start of every session, which for FlowCore is `CLAUDE.md`; tools differ on the filename and not on the idea.

FlowCore's rule about identifier names lives in the instructions file, and it ends by referring to the log rather than restating it — *"Reasoning and worked examples: `docs/decisions.md`, decision 18"*. The same file adds that where the two disagree, the log wins. So a case the rule does not obviously cover gets settled by reading why the rule exists, instead of by guessing at its edge.

That is what a record buys beyond recovery, and it generalises past this one project. **An entry is reusable exactly to the extent that it records why rather than what.** *Full-word identifiers everywhere* transfers nothing to a codebase with different readers; *abbreviations must be decoded rather than read, and the decoding does not get cheaper with familiarity* can be checked against those readers and kept or dropped on the evidence. A conclusion does not travel. A conclusion with its condition attached does, and arrives somewhere it can be argued with — which is [chapter 15](15_principle-loses-scope_b86v.md)'s mechanism running forwards for once, instead of a scope being lost in transmission.

The upstream text has since changed in a way worth one line: it asks a round of questions at once where the frozen version asks one at a time. That is throughput against how much the reader has to hold in working memory, which is a Force with a value, so neither version is a regression.

**The limit, and it is severe.** Grilling is weakest against what this book's author calls a **folk remedy** — advice applied far outside the context it was made for, which stays misapplied because nobody rebuilds its scope. *Depend on abstractions, not concretions* is one, and [chapter 17](17_abstraction-as-insurance_4jk6.md) is the case. A corpus default is the purest instance: there the scope is not merely unrebuilt, because nobody knows one existed. So it never presents itself as a branch point — it is simply how things are done, and the interview does not offer it.

Which means the technique surfaces contested choices and conceals settled ones, and settled-in-the-corpus is the class most likely to be wrong outside the ecosystem it came from. This follows from [chapter 02](02_the-five-kinds_cjx4.md)'s mechanism rather than from any measurement, and it should be read as reasoning rather than as a finding.

**And a second limit, which is easier to walk into: the interview only reaches decisions at the granularity you asked at.** Ask for a whole application and you get an interview about a whole application. The questions are real, the answers are yours, the record is genuine. However, the decisions that could only surface in an interview focused on "failure handling" were not considered, because at the scale of the request they had not been separated out yet.

FlowCore was built in phases for this reason — it calls them slices — and the scope of each one is written into the instructions file rather than left to intention:

```text
In scope: configure workflow, start workflow, get current step,
complete step.
Out of scope: AI review steps, synchronization, failure handling,
scale work.
Do not build ahead into these.
```

The decision log carries the same boundary throughout — *"full definition-side CRUD this slice"*, *"not precedent for building other concurrency machinery this slice"* — so a decision is scoped to the piece it was taken for, and the next piece gets its own interview rather than inheriting an answer.

**Phases are easy to skip in AI-assisted development.** The whole implementation can arrive in an afternoon, and an afternoon does not feel like it needs a plan. Settling the phases before any of it is written is what keeps the decisions far enough apart to be asked about one at a time.

**Not every piece of work needs the phases.** A proof of concept, a script you will delete, an obvious fix with one option — the interview is overhead and the conventional answer is fine. The risk is that the category is decided at the start and not revisited: the one-off that turns out to be the product, and the obvious fix that turns out to be three faults interacting.

## What the entry has to hold

Here is the entry behind the decision the function at the top of this chapter is pared down from. FlowCore's `Get` returns a four-level tree — definition, statuses, steps, actions — and its own log entry is prose; this sets out the same information in the order the reasoning arrived.

```text
 decision    Get returns the whole definition tree, assembled from four
             queries run inside a repeatable-read transaction

 forces      concurrency    definitions are edited while being read
             blast radius   a torn read is a definition that never
                            existed: steps from before an edit,
                            actions from after
             latency        four round trips, against one join whose
                            fan-out is 15 rows to dedupe
             durability     schema; outlives the code that reads it
             callers        a library, so they are strangers

 forced      the transaction, by concurrency and blast radius together
 chosen      four queries over one join; a join is equally atomic, so
             this one is legibility and can go back
 deferred    completion-path locking, until that path is written

 revisit if  definitions stop being editable while readable, or the
             tree stops fitting in four queries
```

**Forced, chosen and deferred are the three lines nothing else in a codebase records.** The code shows a transaction. It does not show that the transaction was forced — that concurrency and blast radius together left no other option — so whoever reads it later cannot tell whether removing it is a cleanup or the data-loss bug at the top of this chapter. The entry says which, in its own words: the wrapper is taken now *"because it's this read's own correctness condition."*

**The chosen line is the one people skip, and it is the most useful.** Four queries against one join is a legibility call, and a join would have satisfied atomicity equally well. Writing that down means the next person can revisit the query shape without reopening the question of whether the read has to be atomic. Without it both look like the same kind of decision, so touching either feels equally risky and nothing gets touched.

**The deferred line is a decision rather than a gap.** Completion-path locking is not missing; it is scheduled against a trigger, and the entry says so — the justification *"is kept local to Get; it's not precedent for building other concurrency machinery this slice."*

And *revisit if* is what makes the entry outlive the decision. Forces move on their own clock ([Ch. 03](03_forces_f4m5.md)), and nothing in a codebase announces it when they do. That line turns the change into something a person can search for.

**Those three lines are the five kinds, run on your own work.** A decision is forced when there was no live alternative — a Law with something to act on, or a situation that left one option. It is chosen when the justification was a Principle, an Idiom or a Style, each of which had alternatives that were real. It is deferred when nothing accumulates while you wait and the trigger can be named.

So *forced or chosen* is this book's opening question pointed at code rather than at advice. [Chapter 01](01_load-bearing_w8kq.md)'s wall is load-bearing by circumstance rather than by nature, and the transaction above is forced by circumstance too — concurrency and blast radius, either of which can move.

**None of this is a new artifact.** [Chapter 12](12_patterns-that-survive-translation_us2k.md) lists the architecture decision record among the patterns that answer team size and turnover, and the original template asks for most of the above in this book's own vocabulary. Michael Nygard's, from 2011: the Context section *"describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local."*

What the entry above adds is two lines. **Forced against chosen** — an ADR's Context can carry it and usually does not, because describing the Forces and saying which of them left no alternative are separate sentences, and only the second tells you what is safe to touch. And **revisit if**, which is not Nygard's Status: a Status is set after a decision has been superseded, where *revisit if* is written before and names the thing to watch for.

---

## Why the claim holds

The claim rests on one asymmetry: a decision is a thing that happened, and a record is a thing that exists.

Code preserves the outcome perfectly and the reason not at all. The transaction is still there in the file, byte for byte, years later. What is not there — and was never there — is the sentence saying that concurrency and blast radius together left no alternative. Forced against chosen is the one thing you cannot reconstruct from the artifact, because both kinds of decision compile to the same bytes.

For a human author, memory covers the gap for a while. It is unreliable and it fades, but it exists, and the fading is what makes *write it down while it is fresh* good advice rather than ceremony.

**Remove the memory and the advice stops being about diligence.** There is no interval during which the reason is available and undocumented, because there was never a moment when it existed anywhere but in a computation that has already been discarded. The record is not a backup of something. It is the only copy there has ever been.

### Each one constrains the next change

The example above loses one reason. What matters is what happens when it is not just one.

Each unrecorded decision constrains the next change without saying so. Someone removes the transaction; the next person notices intermittent bad reads and adds a retry; a third adds a cache to reduce the reads that are now being retried. Every step is locally reasonable and each adds a constraint nobody recorded either. The code accumulates behaviour that is load-bearing and undocumented, and the accumulation is faster than the removal, because removing anything requires knowing what it was for.

What that looks like from outside is a system that works and cannot be changed. The requests to the agentic coding tool become negative — *fix this, do not break that* — because the only thing anyone can specify is the observable behaviour they want preserved, which is another way of saying nobody knows which behaviour is intentional.

**And the agent is in the same position.** This is the part that has no equivalent in the pre-AI version of the story. A codebase that people wrote and failed to document is still readable by people, slowly and expensively. Here the artifact is equally opaque to the agent that produced it, because it kept nothing either. There is no party to the situation who knows more than the code says.

From there the honest options are guessing the design reasons or starting the development from scratch.

**None of this is new.** Undocumented design decisions, accumulated local reasonableness, and a rewrite at the end of it is the ordinary history of a great deal of software written entirely by people. What changed is not the failure. It is that the interval which used to be measured in years can now be measured in weeks, because the rate at which decisions get taken went up by orders of magnitude and the rate at which they get recorded did not move.

---

## Where the claim doesn't apply

### The decision the artifact enforces

The claim says the reason has to survive somewhere. It does not, when the decision is written into something that refuses to be violated.

The transaction above is the bad case precisely because removing it compiles, passes, and runs. Compare a rule put into the schema instead:

```sql
CREATE TABLE revisions (
    definition_id INT,
    revision      INT,
    active        INT,
    UNIQUE (definition_id, active)
);
```

Somebody later decides a definition can have two active revisions at once, and finds out immediately:

```text
IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: revisions.definition_id, revisions.active
```

**Nobody needs to remember why.** The constraint states the decision, enforces it, and objects on its own behalf when a change contradicts it — and the objection arrives at the moment of the change rather than in production, which is the only feedback that reliably survives a hand-off to somebody who was not there.

So the claim has a corollary that is more useful than the claim: where a decision can be made self-enforcing, that is worth more than recording it, because the enforcement does not depend on anybody reading anything. [Chapter 12](12_patterns-that-survive-translation_us2k.md) works the general technique as making illegal states unrepresentable, and [chapter 18](18_six-profiles_dnkz.md) shows the line-of-business profile pushing rules into the schema for the related reason that the schema outlives the code.

The boundary is real and it is narrow. Most design decisions cannot be expressed as a constraint — *four queries rather than one join, because a join fans out to fifteen rows to dedupe* is a judgement, not an invariant. For those the record is the only mechanism there is.

### A decision nobody needs

Most code embodies no decision worth recovering. The name of a local variable, the order of two independent statements, which of two equivalent library calls got used — there is nothing behind these, and treating every line as a lost decision produces a log nobody reads and a review that never ends. [Chapter 03](03_forces_f4m5.md)'s blast radius decides it, pointed at the decision rather than at the code: what does being wrong here cost, and who finds out.

---

## What the claim costs

**Grilling is slow, and the cost is per decision rather than per project.** One question at a time, waiting for each answer, on work that a single sentence would otherwise have produced. On a small change it is absurd overhead, and the honest version of the advice includes the word *sometimes*.

**It requires you to read, not merely to answer.** The failure is not accepting the recommendation — that is the common case and frequently right. It is answering without having understood what was being chosen between, which produces the silent defaults again with a paper trail attached.

Where you did understand it, something is left that no log holds. The trade-off is now yours, and when a related question arrives next month you connect the two. An agent will not do that for you, for the structural reason this chapter has already given. So the connection has to live in a person or in a document.

**The record is partial by construction.** The interview surfaces what the agent presents as a decision, and what it presents comes from the same place its recommendations do. A complete record is not on offer; a record of the contested decisions is.

**And writing it down does not make it right.** A recorded decision is one somebody can disagree with later, which is all that is claimed for it. The chapters before this one are what tell you whether the decision was any good; this one only says that if it goes unwritten, that question stops being askable.

---

## How to recognize the failure

**In a codebase:**

- **A commit that removes something as unnecessary, with no reason given either way.** The change and the thing it removed are now both undocumented, and the second one used to work.
- **Comments that only say what the code does.** A comment restating dense or bad code earns its place, and sometimes it is all there is time for. The signal is when every comment in a file is of that kind, because the reason is then nowhere: not in the code, and not beside it.
- **Defensive code nobody will touch.** A retry, a lock, a sleep, a `try` that catches everything — kept because removing it once caused the billing module to fail, and nobody remembers why.
- **A test suite that passes and a system nobody will change.** The tests encode the behaviour that was known when they were written and none of the reasons, so they say a change is safe without being able to say it is correct.

**In a conversation:**

- **"Fix this, don't break that."** The request is negative because the observable behaviour is the only thing anybody can still specify.
- **"I don't know why it does that, but leave it."** An accurate report of the situation, and the last point at which asking is cheap.
- **"Let's just regenerate it"** — meaning throw the code away and prompt for it again. Sometimes correct, and cheaper than it used to be. It also guarantees the replacement arrives with no recorded decisions either, so the next person is where you are now.
- **"It was working yesterday."** Said about a system whose working state nobody can characterise, which is what makes the sentence unanswerable.

The question that does the work: **what would tell us why this was done?**

*What* rather than *who*, because the answer is not always a person. If it is a person, ask them now. If it is a document, this chapter does not apply to you.

And if the answer is that somebody would read the code and work it out, that somebody is doing the job this chapter is about, so it is worth being exact about what the job is. Reading is rarely enough by itself. You read it, you test it, and you arrive at *this looks like it was written to support Y and Z*. Then you ask the people who might know, and they half-remember different things — A says one, B says another, and neither was there for the part that matters. Where the code came from an agent there is nobody in that position at all, which is the same predicament with a step removed.

What you end up holding is not an answer but a position. Fixing Y changes Z; some customers depend on Z; leaving Y another month costs you a different customer. Nobody in that conversation is being unreasonable and nobody is going to win it, because **there is no fact available that settles it** — and one sentence, written at the time by whoever chose Y, is what would have.

[Chapter 22](22_assigned-to-the-team_3fjx.md) closes the book on the arrangement that produces the software — the four artifacts that stand between a request and something that runs, who each one belongs to, and where this chapter's own record sits among them.
